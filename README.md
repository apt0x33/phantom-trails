# PhantomLayer: Observations of a Dormant Infrastructure

Recently, I came across a suspicious PDF titled *malcore.pdf* shared on a private CTI feed. It appeared benign, but further analysis revealed metadata referencing `apt0x33`.

### Summary of Findings

- **File hash**: `eac56a5fe42381b...` *(truncated)*
- **Observed domain**: `phantomlayer.onion` (dark web)
- **Indicators**:
  - Metadata string: `LibreOffice Phantom`
  - Suspicious internal author: `apt0x33`
  - Referenced location: `phantom-archive.tor`

Though limited in scope, these artifacts show strong similarity to Lazarus Group tradecraft (but not conclusively).

Feel free to open a PR with more artifacts if youâ€™ve seen anything similar.
